Summary of Part 4 
Nabiha Khan 

For part 4, I implemented the following features:
Mandatory features
1. View Visible Photos. This is done in the 'images' directory from the home
page after the user logs in. All the photos are in divs containing the information
of the photo including the poster, timestamp, the image itself, caption, a botton to 
tag users (not implemented), and a list of users tagged. 

2. View further photo info (done with previous feauture)

3. Post a photo. This is done in the upload page. The user has the option to select all followers
or whatever groups the user owns. 

Optional Features 
1. Manage Follows. This is done in the follow page and manage friend requests page. 
In the follow page, the user enters the username of a user they desire to follow. 
In the manageFriendRequests page, the user chooses from the list of users and either accepts
or declines the requests. 

2. Add friend group. This is done in the create friend group page. The user enters a 
name for a friend group, and if that name is not already used by the user, then it gets 
created.
